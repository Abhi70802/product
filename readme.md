This Java solution provides a framework for a delivery route planning application. It includes several classes: Location for geographical coordinates, Order for managing orders, RouteCalculator interface and HaversineRouteCalculator for calculating distances, DeliveryRoute for holding a delivery route, and DeliveryPlanner for planning the route. The DeliveryPlanner uses a Nearest Neighbor algorithm to determine the most efficient path for delivering multiple orders, considering the distances between various pickup and delivery points. This solution is designed with modularity, readability, and extensibility in mind, suitable for further development and scaling.
